        <h1>About me</h1>
      
    <br><br>
    I am originally from Florida. I moved to South Korea in 2014 and I worked as an English teacher.  
    I started out in the Public School system, but for the last few years my wife 
    and I have run our own home school business. It has been a lot of fun but 
    I am ready to transition to a life back home. My degree is in Psychology. I hope
    to be able to use concepts like color psychology and apply those skills to designing 
    unique and practical designs.  
<br><br>

     My first experience with programming was in 1998. I started building simple little angelfire sites. I got 
     involved with doing some very basic HTML building. I eventually moved onto C++. I picked up a book called " Learn C++ in 24
     hours". C++ has a very long write time and it takes forever to get anything done. It is a highly performant 
     language at run time but the write time is very long and drawn out. 

     <br><br>

     I got back into programming around two years ago. I started back up with Python. It is 
     much more straight forward than C++ but since it is a backend language I also got a little bit bored
     with it. I started poking around with Javascript and CSS and started building things and 
     I stuck with that. My process is to find things I want to build and figure out a way to build them. 

     <br><br>
 
     These days I am transitioning into more of a UX design focus. When I first started out I kept all styiling 
     to a minimum. I only wanted enough styling to test whether or not my Javascript was working. But these days 
     I enjoy focusing on design related things. I mainly use figma for all design related tasks. I do all sketches
     and mockups within that software. I'm slowly starting to develop more sophisticated designs and mockups. 

     <br><br>
      I have a strong preference for working
    for a small company. I think working for a small company or startup would be more 
    interesting because in those roles I would probably need to dabble in a lot of different kinds of 
    tech. It would be fun to be able to pitch in on design related problems as well as get 
    involved with other aspects of web dev. If you would like to discuss things further please feel free to contact me.
