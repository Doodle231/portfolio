<h1>About Me</h1>

<div id ="paragraph-wrapper">
<p>I enjoy long walks on the beach and candle light dinners.  I also enjoy 
    programming and coding.  I’m completely self taught, although that is kind
     of a loaded way to phrase things. I have learned a ton from some very talented developers but I have never taken a formal class in programming. My first exposure to 
     programming was back in 1998. I had a pretty rockin angelfire website ( I’m a contrarian so I didn’t jump aboard the geocities train despite it being more popular at the time) . 
     I was very much into computer hardware and anything related to tech. 
</p>

<p>I built my little angelfire site and moved onto C++. Back then the internet wasn’t quite as robust as it is now. There was no youtube so it was a bit tricky to get into programming without a solid mentor. I had no interest at the time in pursing coding as a career as I 
    was about 14 years old. I was more interested in playing guitar 
    and video games. But I coded a bit as a hobby. Admittedly I didn’t make it too far past my little hellow world app. </p>

<p>
    After a nearly 20 year break from coding I jumped back into it . Once again I just got bored with it. I couldn’t quite connect the point of what I was supposed to do with all of this manipulation of data. After a few weeks
     I started dabbling with javascript. I was working as an English teacher at the time and I was playing Monopoly with my students and I realized that even though the game is terribly outdated, it would make for a great learning tool to learn how to code. I really started to enjoy coding from that point on. 
     Even now I like to go back on that little project and fix messy code. I like to constantly look for things to add. </p>

     <p>Most recently I started working more on designs. I just started a web design company. 
        A big reason I launched my business is to get noticed and to try to help small businesses. I just don’t want to be that guy who is just trying to study algorithims for 6 months in the hopes that maybe I can get a job. 
         I’m not going to pretend like I’m some sort of 10x developer who has all of these data structures and algorithms available from memory. 
        I want to solve real problems even if those problems are very simple. </p>

        <p>I have  a lot to learn as a junior developer. Unfortunately the job market is in such a state where a lot of junior devs have to try to potray themselves as some wizard 
            developer who eats, sleeps, and codes. I have been at this for several years and I’m still learning.  I’m sure the first real production codebase will be a real tough challenge for me. I’m also sure that my code isn’t professional caliber. 
            All of this is fine. I am willing to put 
            my ego aside and be molded to be made better. </p>
