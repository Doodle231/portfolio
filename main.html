        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am originally from Florida. I have a B.A in psychology. I moved to South Korea around 8 years ago to teach English. 
        I worked within the public school styem for several years. 
        Eventually I moved on and opened a home school with my wife here in South Korea. 
    <br><br>
    In terms of coding I have tried to keep my tech stack very simple. I use html , css, javascript primarily. 
    I spent several hundred hours coding without frameworks and focused on ES6 syntax. 
    More recently I have started to add some libraries and other build tools to speed things up a bit. Iâ€™m a big fan of keeping things simple and not overcomplicating things. 
     
    
     My main method of learning has been to build things. I'm hoping I can find a company
     that focuses on building real world projects and not simply wrote memorizing of algorightms for coding tests. 
     
     <br><br> 

     I am currently located in South Korea. I am an American citizen so there is no issue related to 
     visas. I would definitely prefer to work remotely, but I also realize that it may be difficult 
     for a junior designer or developer to work remotely. For these reasons I am also willing to relocate to anywhere
     within the United States if the position is a good fit.
